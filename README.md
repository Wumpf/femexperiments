Experimenting with Finite Element Methods in Unity

## What is this
Just me learning some things about the math and implementation of Finite Element Methods for physics simulation while getting Unity better to know. No clear goal so far - maybe I'll end up making some tiny game with soft body physics, let's see.

## Sources
I never took any courses on the topic, although some of the courses I took in university briefly touched on the matter. What I've learned/I'm learning I got mostly from ...

* Wikipedia article on soft body dynamics  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft-body_dynamics
* Ricioulsy old but good introduction on FEM  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpj3cZrKn4
* Very good video lectures on FEM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSaUHDQf204&t=2s
* Pretty slides about CST triangle elements
http://www.fkm.utm.my/~taminmn/SME%203033%20Finite%20Element%20Method/07-CST%20elements.pdf
* On mass matrices. Containst among other useful things the derivation of (consistent) mass matrices for CST and LST triangle elements
